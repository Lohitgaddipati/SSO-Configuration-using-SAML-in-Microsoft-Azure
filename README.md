In my endeavor to optimize user access management and security, I successfully configured Single Sign-On (SSO) using Azure Portal. 

This comprehensive project involved creating and configuring the application, managing certificates, and fine-tuning settings for seamless SSO.

This achievement showcases my proficiency in SSO setup and demonstrates my commitment to enhancing user access control and digital security. 

I've gained valuable skills in SSO implementation in cloud, making me a strong candidate for roles focused on security and user authentication.
